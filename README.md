# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Web Application 💻

This project tackles the challenge of stock price prediction by developing a web application using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models. The application is built with **Django** as the web framework, **HTML** for structuring content, **CSS** for styling, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design. This application provides users with a user-friendly platform to explore potential market trends and make informed decisions.

## Features ✨
- **📊 Stock Price Prediction**: Predicts future stock prices using LSTM models.
- **🖥️ User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

### Front-End 🎨
- **HTML**: Structuring content on the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the web pages for a clean and modern look.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for creating a responsive design with pre-built components.
- **JavaScript**: Handling interactive elements on the web pages.

### Back-End 🔧
- **Django (Python)**: Web framework for the back-end logic and API handling.

### Machine Learning Model 🤖
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: The core model used for predicting stock prices based on historical data.
