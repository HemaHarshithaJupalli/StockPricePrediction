# Stock Price Prediction Web Application

This project tackles the challenge of stock price prediction by developing a web application using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models. The application is built with **Django** as the web framework, **HTML** for structuring content, **CSS** for styling, and **Bootstrap** for responsive design. This application provides users with a user-friendly platform to explore potential market trends and make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predicts future stock prices using LSTM models.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End
- **HTML**: Structuring content on the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the web pages for a clean and modern look.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for creating a responsive design with pre-built components.
- **JavaScript**: Handling interactive elements on the web pages.

### Back-End
- **Django (Python)**: Web framework for the back-end logic and API handling.

### Machine Learning Model
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: The core model used for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install required dependencies.
3. Run the Django server and access the application on your local browser.
